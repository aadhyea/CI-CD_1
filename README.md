# This is a sample CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker and GitHub WebHooks

1. Install Jenkins in a Docker Container. [This](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/) is how you can do it.

2. Go to the local instance of Jenkins (https://localhost:8080/) and configure it.

3. Create your application in any lannguage. Add a Jenkinsfile, to outline your pipeline stages and steps.
